        Project Name: Hybrid Solar PV/T Desalination System Using Solar Still
      </h1>

      <p>
        Our team’s goal was to develop an innovative and sustainable solution
        that addresses two pressing global problems: energy efficiency and
        scarcity of clean water. We designed and experimentally assessed a
        hybrid solar PV/T desalination solution that combines solar electricity
        production with water purification using passive solar stills.
      </p>

      <p>
        PV panels are often less efficient the hotter they become from sunlight.
        To address this heat challenge, we placed the solar still directly
        beneath the PV panel. This allowed the still to draw heat away from the
        PV along with sufficient energy to evaporate and condense water vapor,
        yielding distilled drinking water.
      </p>

      <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
      <p>
        My role in this project consisted mostly of system design, simulation,
        and field implementation. I used SolidWorks and Autodesk Fusion 360 to
        model the structural layout and thermal contact between the PV panel and
        the still.
      </p>
      <p>
        For computational simulation, I used ANSYS Fluent to observe heat
        transfer behavior including conduction, convection, temperature
        distributions, and flow patterns. I also conducted experimental tests in
        a real-world environment to monitor system performance, compare it to
        simulation data, and adjust design specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also utilized OriginLab for graphing and statistical analyses of
        experiments including temperature profiles, water generation rates, and
        PV panel efficiencies before and after cooling.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The results showed promising outcomes. We witnessed a clear gain in
        electrical efficiency of the PV panel due to passive cooling, along with
        consistent clean water generation every day. This hybrid system proved
        to be highly energy-efficient and scalable—particularly suitable for
        off-grid, rural, or arid areas with limited access to electricity and
        clean water.
      </p>

      <p>
        The PV/T system is entirely passive and requires no additional energy
        except sunlight—making it an energy-efficient, low-cost, and
        environmentally friendly solution.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        This project allowed me to explore the intersection of mechanical
        design, thermal systems, and environmental engineering. It provided
        hands-on experience in creating practical solutions aligned with the
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in clean energy and
        clean water accessibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, this work is a meaningful step toward decentralized and
        self-sufficient renewable energy systems.
