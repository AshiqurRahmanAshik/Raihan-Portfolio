      <h1>Biomimetic Fixed-Wing Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)</h1>

      <p>
        The project's aim was to conduct analysis and design optimization for
        the aerodynamic performance of a biomimetic fixed-wing Micro Aerial
        Vehicle (MAV). This analysis was inspired by the leading-edge tubercles
        on the flippers of the humpback whale with the intent of improving the
        aerodynamic performance characteristics of small Unmanned Aerial
        Vehicles (UAVs) through nature-inspired geometry.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project addressed limitations such as poor stall performance,
        instability at low Reynolds numbers, and low maneuverability. By
        altering the leading edge of the wing with tubercle geometries, we
        anticipated improved stall behavior and lift-to-drag ratio, while
        achieving stable and efficient performance in flight.
      </p>

      <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
      <p>
        I was responsible for the computational design and simulation phase of
        the project. I created multiple wing configurations with varying
        tubercle amplitudes and wavelengths using SolidWorks. These wing designs
        were then meshed and simulated in ANSYS Fluent using turbulence models
        like IDDES to capture unsteady flow separation and vortex dynamics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flow visualizations, pressure distribution analyses, and performance
        metrics such as lift coefficient (CL), drag coefficient (CD), and
        lift-to-drag ratio (CL/CD) were evaluated against a baseline wing. After
        multiple simulation iterations, we identified an optimal tubercle
        configuration that improved wing performance across a wide range of
        angles of attack, particularly in the post-stall region.
      </p>

      <h2>Experimental Validation</h2>
      <p>
        We also fabricated physical MAV wing models using lightweight materials
        and tested them in our university’s subsonic wind tunnel. The
        experimental outcomes closely matched our simulation results, confirming
        that biomimetic designs improved stall delay and lift generation.
      </p>

      <p>
        These enhancements are especially valuable for MAVs operating in
        constrained environments like urban surveillance, disaster monitoring,
        and environmental data collection.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        This project highlighted how biomimicry can significantly influence
        engineering design—particularly in fields like aerospace where
        performance and efficiency are critical. I gained valuable hands-on
        experience in simulation, aerodynamic analysis, and interdisciplinary
        problem-solving, which I am excited to further explore in future
        research and development projects within aerospace and UAV design.
