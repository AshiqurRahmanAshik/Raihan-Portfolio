      <h1>Biomimetic Leading-Edge Tubercles in Fixed-Wing MAVs</h1>

      <p>
        Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) operate at low Reynolds numbers, typically
        ranging from 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup>. At these conditions,
        aerodynamic flows are susceptible to phenomena such as laminar
        separation bubbles, which result in early stall and a deterioration in
        aerodynamic performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This study investigates the effect of humpback whale-inspired
        leading-edge tubercles on the aerodynamic performance of a fixed-wing
        MAV. The wing profile is derived from the S5010 airfoil and tested at a
        Reynolds number of 1×10<sup>5</sup>. The wing features a rectangular
        planform with an aspect ratio of 1.5. Tubercles are applied with an
        amplitude of 0.5 cm and a wavelength of 4.29 cm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Numerical simulations were conducted to compare two configurations: the
        baseline model (without tubercles) and the tubercle model (with
        leading-edge tubercles). Key aerodynamic parameters—lift coefficient
        (CL) and drag coefficient (CD)—were evaluated across different angles of
        attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        Results showed that at a 25° angle of attack, the tubercle model
        exhibited a 3.13% higher lift coefficient than the baseline.
        Additionally, the drag coefficient remained lower for the tubercle model
        at key angles (15°, 20°, and 25°). Importantly, the stall was delayed by
        3° in the tubercle model, highlighting its stall-resistant behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        These findings demonstrate that biomimetic adaptation through
        leading-edge tubercles can significantly improve the aerodynamic
        efficiency and stall characteristics of fixed-wing MAVs—making them
        better suited for applications requiring enhanced stability and
        endurance, such as environmental monitoring, surveillance, and disaster
        response.
