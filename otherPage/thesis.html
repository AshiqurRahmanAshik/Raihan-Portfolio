      <p>
        As part of my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Rajshahi
        University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), I undertook a one-year
        undergraduate research thesis titled
        <strong
          >"Effect of Swept Angle and Wing Profile on the Aerodynamic
          Performance of Fixed-Wing Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)"</strong
        >. This research was supervised by
        <strong>Dr. Md. Rokunuzzaman</strong>, Professor, Department of
        Mechanical Engineering, RUET.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main objective was to study how the wing’s geometric
        characteristics—specifically sweep angle and airfoil shape—affect
        aerodynamic performance of MAVs at low Reynolds numbers. With MAVs
        increasingly used in reconnaissance, disaster response, and
        environmental monitoring, improving their lift-efficiency and
        maneuverability is critical.
      </p>

      <h2>Research Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The study began with an extensive literature review on airfoil
        performance and low-speed vehicle aerodynamics. I then designed multiple
        wing types with different sweep angles (0°–30°), using the S5010 airfoil
        in various configurations: Baseline, Tapered, Backward Swept, Forward
        Swept, and combinations with tapered tips.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using SolidWorks, I created 3D models of each wing while keeping
        fuselage geometry constant. For simulations, I used ANSYS Fluent with
        RANS (k-ω SST and IDDES) models to analyze performance indicators like
        lift coefficient, drag coefficient, pressure distribution, and flow
        separation behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Simulation & Results</h2>
      <p>
        Mesh quality and independence were ensured using Y+ optimization, proper
        inflation layers, and minimal skewness. The results showed significant
        performance differences among wing types. Moderate backward-swept wings
        delayed stall and improved lift characteristics, while some profiles
        achieved higher lift-to-drag ratios at specific angles of attack.
      </p>

      <p>
        Results were visualized using Tecplot and OriginLab with Cp
        distributions, pressure fields, and velocity vectors. The findings
        helped identify the most promising wing configuration for MAV
        applications, offering valuable insights into efficient and stable MAV
        flight design.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills & Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Through this thesis, I deepened my expertise in Computational Fluid
        Dynamics (CFD), aerodynamic theory, and design optimization using
        engineering software. The thesis contributed to two international
        conferences and sparked my ongoing interest in biomimetic aerodynamics
        and UAV design.
