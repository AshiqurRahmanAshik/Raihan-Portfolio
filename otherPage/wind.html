      <p>
        As part of my continuous professional and academic development in
        sustainable energy and fluid mechanics, I attended a specialized short
        course titled
        <strong
          >"Harnessing the Wind: Analytical, Numerical and Experimental
          Approaches to Wind Energy"</strong
        >
        conducted by the Institute of Energy and Environmental Studies (IEES) at
        Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET).
      </p>

      <p>
        This three-day intensive program provided a holistic understanding of
        wind energy systems through a blend of theoretical foundations,
        simulation training, and experimental techniques. The course was led by
        national and international experts in wind and renewable energy.
      </p>

      <h2>Course Highlights</h2>
      <p>
        Topics covered included aerodynamic principles of wind turbines, site
        assessment techniques, and performance evaluation metrics. Special
        emphasis was given to integrated modeling approaches using software like
        ANSYS and modeFrontier. I received practical training in CFD,
        Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO), and simulation-driven turbine
        design.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most valuable experiences was working on real-world case
        studies involving both onshore and offshore wind energy systems.
        Experimental modules introduced us to wind tunnel testing and result
        validation techniques for blade design and turbine aerodynamics.
      </p>

      <p>
        The course also provided training in interpreting CFD results,
        optimizing turbine performance, and understanding the lifecycle of wind
        energy systems. An optional wind farm site visit was proposed to offer
        industrial context to the learning modules.
      </p>

      <h2>Outcome & Impact</h2>
      <p>
        I successfully completed the course and received a certificate of
        participation. The knowledge and skills acquired—from analytical methods
        to hands-on simulations—greatly enhanced my perspective on sustainable
        energy. This experience has equipped me with valuable tools applicable
        to both academic research and real-world renewable energy projects.
